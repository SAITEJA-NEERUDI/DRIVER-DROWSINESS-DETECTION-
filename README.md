# DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION-
Driver Drowsiness Detection with Visual Behavior and Machine Learning
This project tackles the critical issue of driver drowsiness by leveraging visual cues and machine learning. By analyzing facial landmarks captured through a webcam, the system employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to detect signs of fatigue and alert the driver before potential accidents occur.

Key Features:

Real-time Webcam Analysis: Utilizes OpenCV for continuous video processing and facial feature extraction.
SVM-based Drowsiness Detection: Trains and utilizes an SVM model to classify drowsiness based on extracted features like eye closure and mouth shape.
Visual Alerts: Warns the driver of drowsiness through on-screen messages.
